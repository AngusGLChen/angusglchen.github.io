Dr. Guanliang Chen is a Lecturer in the Faculty of Information Technology, [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/), Australia. Prior to joining Monash University, he obtained his Ph.D. from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics & Computer Science, [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) (TU Delft) in the Netherlands.

Guanliang is interested in the following research fields:
- Artificial Intelligence in Education
- Natural Language Processing
- Learning Analytics
- Educational Data Mining

In particular, Guanliang aims to apply state-of-the-art language technologies to make use of the textual data collected in various educational settings (e.g., Q&A pairs in discussion forums, instructor-crafted feedback, and student-generated reflective statements) to construct a more inclusive learning environment. His research work is centered around two themes:

- Fairness, accountability, and transparency of Machine Learning techniques in education;
- Automatic collection and generation of quality educational materials (e.g., assessment questions and informative feedback).

For **prospective students**: I am always looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students, who have a strong interest in educational research, to work with me. I'm also happy to work with master and undergraduate students at Monash University. If you are interested, please contact me via guanliang.chen@monash.edu.
